# my-recipe-app

Application provides possibility to search for a cooking recipe. It's available thanks to API created by Jonas Schmedtmann in colaboration with Forkify API which was shutted down. User can also display the selected recipe from the search list. Each recipe contains the ingredients needed for the meal. It is possible to change amount of ingredients based on number of servings. Both cook time and amount of ingredients may not be 100% accurate due to my lack of cooking experience:). Another feature is that You can like the specific recipe which will be stored in browser memory thanks to localStorage function. Next time You visit the app there will be recipes waiting for You.

This project uses materials from the tutorial called "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!" created by Jonas Schmedtmann.
